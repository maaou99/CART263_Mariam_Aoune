# Tic Tac Toe with p5.js

This program allows two players to play tic tac toe

## Strategy and deconstruction of the code 

1. The computer draws a 3x3 grid or, in other words, nine squares.

## Persisting Problems 
1. After the game has resarted, meaning it has already been played once, the program does not always 
identify the winner. 
2. Currently, player 1 must double click to start the game. Ideally, the game starts after one click
3. There is no counter.

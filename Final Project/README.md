# Playful Interaction project
##### Mariam Aoune & Maloney Khim, April 11th. 

In our final project, we want to create a game where the user can build their own pet with legos and interact with it. 
It is inspired by the imagination of children who have fun creating characters and objects with legos.
First, the player builds an animal with the legos blocks and then they take a picture inside a delimited zone.
The program detects the legos and then a score system based on affection appears on the side of the screen. The user can only click inside of the red square, they cannot click outside of it. There is a background of a jungle with gifs of plants around the animal.
We can then interact with the pet by petting them (hovering the mouse over the animal),feeding them (dragging some food to them) 
and talking to them (speaking specifics phrases like "I love you!" or "Good boy!"). 
Each time the user does one of those actions, the affection points goes up until it reaches the max score and the user gets congratulated.

## Installation
First, download the project folder on GitHub. Then download the p5.speech library and put it in the libraries folder. 

## Run
To run the code, open the project folder on Visual Studio Code and make it go live. Build an animal with the red lego blocks. Connect a webcam to the computer and ideally, go sit next to the windows and take the picture of the lego block pet near a white wall. The animal has to be inside the square red frame. Then, the user can interact with the animal on the computer screen by either petting it, feeding it, or talking to it. The user cannnot interact with their pet if they click outside the red square.

## Future iterations
We would love to find a way to make our code create a digital drawing based on the picture taken. It would detect the color of the block (red), and recreate the lego blocks animal with shapes in p5js. The animal will then be placed in the middle of the background.

## Notes on code comments and documentation

Documentation is a critical part of writing code. It is for you, but also for others you might want to share your code with. If you have ever used code written by someone else, think about what they could have done to help you understand it better. If you're proud of your code, documenting it can help others learn.

Imagine: its 2 years from now and you've completely forgotten what you wrote, and your gallery show has to be installed tomorrow. Your code almost works, but you can't remember what you wrote. What might help you make changes quickly and remember what you write?

- Always comment your code. Add your name and project title in the main code file.  
- Every function should be named described clearly according to what they do.  
- All variables should have clear and reasonable names that describe what they do. 
- Sections of code that make decisions or perform complex tasks should be described clearly in comments.  
- Sections of code borrowed from other places should be cited and linked.  
- Old code should be removed!  
- Make your readme file clear and readable.

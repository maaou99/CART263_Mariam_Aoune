# Project 1 - Particles With Personalities

This project aimed to visualize and animate particles behaving in a specific context. 

## Brainstroming

The idea given to me was "feeling left out in a club." With this topic, I was guided to code particles behaving in a specific manner. However, before coding, I needed to visualize what I would create. So I decided to make a mood board to illustrate my thought process.

As indicated at the bottom of my mood board, one way to describe the topic was through a storyline. At first, a group of 'particles'  (people) scatter around the space and find their own area to stay in and party. However, there is one particle who feels a sense of loneliness. Although they are surrounded by people and trying to enjoy the moment, they still disconnect from their surroundings. They become victims of their thoughts, leading to mental dissociation. 


## Structure of the code 

My p5.js file applied object-oriented programming to structure the code, improve readability, encourage usability, and develop advanced concept skills.
Classes, methods and a constructor were used, as mentioned in class. I also used the polar.js library to create a geometric shape using sin(). 

## Difficulties encountered

1. Applying a specific tone of colours was challenging. Although I displayed certain colours for the first part of the code, I would've wished a specific colour palette (pastel colours) had been used for the second part of the animation. 

2. I would like to improve the unnatural movement of particles in the program's first half. Learning and utilizing the noise() method is a concept I should work more on to fix this problem.
